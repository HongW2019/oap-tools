# OAP Project Overview

Optimized Analytics Package (OAP) for Spark platform is a open source project for multiple Spark optimizations and features driving by Intel and the community.
Spark is powerful and well optimized in a lot of aspects.  But we still face a few challenges for Spark to the next level performance.

- The JVM and row-based computing engine preventing Spark to be fully optimized for Intel hardware, for example AVX/AVX512, GPU

- The current implementation of key aspects, such as memory management & shuffle didnâ€™t consider the latest technology advancements,  like PMEM

- The batch processing engine a lot of times cannot satisfy the need of queries with high performance requirement.

OAP Project is targeted to optimize Spark in these aspects above, now it has 8 components including SQL DS Cache,
Native SQL Engine, Arrow Data Source, OAP MLlib, PMem Spill, PMem Common, PMem Shuffle and Remote Shuffle.
